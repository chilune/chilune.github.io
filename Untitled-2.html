<p>My strengths are art and English. I lived in America for 6 years, since I was 5 to when I was 11. During that time, I got used to speaking English and communicating with native speaker, so as a result, my English is one of my stronger points.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have various favorite foods. I also love watching anime, playing Genshin Impact, listening to music, my family, friends, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Haikyuu! (the first anime I ever watched and also one of my favorites, if not favorite, anime of all time)&nbsp;</p>
