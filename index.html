<h1>QiQi's Introduction</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is QiQi. I'm twelve years old,<a href="file:///Users/students/Documents/Adobe/Photoshop%20Cloud%20Associates/Untitled-2.html"> and</a> I'll be turning 13 in May next year.</p>
<p>I like art, basketball and speech. I've been drawing since I was four years old, playing basketball since I was about 9, and I started speech around the same time. I also enjoy reading -- a few of my favorite books are The Song Of Achilles, The Giver, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since I grew up in California, reading is one of my passions :D<br>
  <br>
A few miscellaneous facts about me:<br>
1. One of the places that I've been wanting to go to is Japan, because the culture is really cool (good food, nice views, anime, etc.). Another is Paris, because I've always wanted to see the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, also see the architecture and eat the food <br>
2.&nbsp; I really love music - I've been into Japanese music lately. A few of my favorite songs are Pretender (Official Hige Dandism), for him. ( Troye Sivan and allday),&nbsp; Older &amp; smiling when i die ( Sasha Sloan),&nbsp;花に亡霊 &amp; だから僕は音楽を辞めた (Yorushika), Zenzenzense, Sparkle, Katawaredoki, Date, Nandemonaiya (RADWIMPS), all the kids are depressed &amp; comethru (Jeremy Zucker), etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
