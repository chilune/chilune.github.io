<h1>AI Painter</h1>

<p>DESCRIPTION<br>
</p>
<p>AI art is when a machine is programmed to create images by piecing together or altering existing pictures. There has been some controversy over whether this can be considered as real art. Some believe that it can, arguing that art is not defined by the process, but rather the result. Others think that it can't, considering topics like creativity and originality. In the end, it all depends on your definition of art. Either way, AI art has made a splash in the world of art -- popular media have started covering stories about it, museums and galleries are beginning to display images created by AI. But while AI art allows for a vast, endless array of possibilities, the future for independent artists may be bleak. Slowly, they might get replaced by AI artists, which is the sad truth.</p>
<p>DREAM AI ART</p>
<p>The first AI art generator that I used was Dream AI, the website link is www.wombo.art/create. I generated these pieces with the artstyle "Daydream" and photoshopped them next to each other to create three pictures in total.&nbsp; This AI generates art based on text, so all you have to do is enter the prompt you want the AI to create art based off of. For example, I typed in "Japanese koi pond" and got the first picture.&nbsp; AI painters create art with algorithms that analyze existing images, or the work of human artists. Some AI painters combine existing images together to create new art.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>GAUGAN AI ART</p>
<p>The second AI art generator I used was Gaugan AI. This AI painter can generate realistic images from just doodles. It provides you with a number of material brushes (such as "sea," "clouds," "gravel," etc.), which you can draw on the canvas -- just a basic doodle is enough. With just a few strokes, you can create amazing images.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
